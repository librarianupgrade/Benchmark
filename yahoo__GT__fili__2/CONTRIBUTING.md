Contributing
============

If you are considering contributing to Fili, thank you! We welcome all contributions, big or small. The only thing we
ask is that you try to abide by the style and conventions of the project. Many of the conventions are enforced by
automated checks, but we also have documented the conventions in a more human-friendly format. 
[The documents](docs/contributing) are still being made more complete, extended, and enhanced, so feel free to
contribute to those as well!
