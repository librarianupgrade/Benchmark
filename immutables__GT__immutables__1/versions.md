Version scheme
--------------

As a cheatsheet

* `0.0.0-milestone-somethingN` — for arbitrary milestones with specific features
* `0.0.0-alphaN` — non-feature complete early release
* `0.0.0-betaN` — feature complete (softly feature complete, a little bit lax here, but that is intentional)
* `0.0.0-rcN` — strongly feature complete with all expected fixes release candidates
* `0.0.0` — ga releases (we don't use "final", "release", or "ga" suffixes)
