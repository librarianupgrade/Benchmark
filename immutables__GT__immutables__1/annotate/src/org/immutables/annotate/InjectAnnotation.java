/**
 * Meta-annotation that if detected on the annotation, will turn target annotation into special
 * instruction to inject derived annotation code into target places. This annotated annotations -
 * directives are called <em>injection annotations</em>, the derived annotation's code to be
 * inserted is called <em>target annotation</em>. The injection annotations
 * themselves are to be placed on attributes, abstract value types or packages, impacting all
 * covered types and attributes for injection of target annotations (see {@link #type()},
 * {@link #code()}) into specified placed (see {@link Where}) of the generated classes.
 * <h5>Examples</h5>
 * 1) Inject Deprecated into fields "a" and "b" of the generated class
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;InjectAnnotation(type = Deprecated.class, target = Where.FIELD)
 * &#64;interface InjectDeprecated {}
 * 
 * &#64;Value.Immutable
 * &#64;InjectDeprecated
 * interface Val {
 *   int a();
 * 
 *   int b();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 2) Inject @TargetAnn(message="I'm BUILDER", of="Val2") onto generated ImmutableVal2.Builder
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;interface TargetAnn {
 *   String message();
 * 
 *   String of();
 * }
 * 
 * &#64;InjectAnnotation(type = TargetAnn.class, code = "(message=[[echo]], of=\"[[!name]]\")", target = Where.BUILDER_TYPE)
 * &#64;interface InjectBuilderTarget {
 *   String echo();
 * }
 * 
 * &#64;Value.Immutable
 * &#64;InjectBuilderTarget(echo = "I'm BUILDER")
 * interface Val2 {
 *   int a();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 3) Inject Point(x = 2, y = 3) on field "a" and Point(x = 4, y = 5) on field "b"
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;interface Point {
 *   int x();
 * 
 *   int y();
 * }
 * 
 * &#64;InjectAnnotation(code = "@Point([[*]])", target = Where.FIELD)
 * // watch-out for the relative or qualified name when putting annotation name into code attribute
 * // that would be inserted and resolved from a generated code. Putting FQCN is recommended.
 * &#64;interface PointInject {
 *   int x();
 * 
 *   int y();
 * }
 * 
 * &#64;Value.Immutable
 * interface Val2 {
 *   &#64;PointInject(x = 2, y = 3)
 *   String a();
