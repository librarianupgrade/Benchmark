### Alfresco Data Model
Data model is a library packaged as a jar file which is part of [Alfresco Content Services Repository](https://community.alfresco.com/docs/DOC-6385-project-overview-repository).
The library contains the following:
* Dictionary, Repository and Search Services interfaces
* Models for data types and Dictionary implementation
* Parsers

Please note that the data model uses version 2 of the Jackson libraries. 
The upgrade from version 1 was not backward compatible, any projects
that are dependent on data model using Jackson 1.x should use the data-model 6.N branch.
