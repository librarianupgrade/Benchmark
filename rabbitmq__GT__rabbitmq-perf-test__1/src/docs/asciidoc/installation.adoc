== Installation

=== From Binary

PerfTest is distributed as an uber JAR from https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test/releases[GitHub releases].

WARNING: The `tar.gz` and `zip` archives are deprecated and will be removed in PerfTest 3.0.
Use the uber JAR file instead.

It is also available on https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.rabbitmq%22%20AND%20a%3A%22perf-test%22[Maven Central] if one needs to use it as library.

Milestone releases or release candidates are available from https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test/releases[GitHub releases].

https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-tools-binaries-dev/releases?q=rabbitmq-perf-test[Snapshots] are also available.
The https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-tools-binaries-dev/releases/download/v-rabbitmq-perf-test-latest/perf-test-latest.jar[latest snapshot] is available at a stable URL (useful for automation).

To verify a PerfTest installation, use:

 java -jar perf-test.jar --help

=== From Docker Image

PerfTest has a https://hub.docker.com/r/pivotalrabbitmq/perf-test/[Docker image] as well.
To use it:

 docker run -it --rm pivotalrabbitmq/perf-test:latest --help

Note that the Docker container needs to be able to connect to the host where
the RabbitMQ broker runs.  Find out more at
https://docs.docker.com/network/[Docker network documentation].  Once the
Docker container where PerfTest runs can connect to the RabbitMQ broker,
PerfTest can be run with the regular options, e.g.:

 docker run -it --rm pivotalrabbitmq/perf-test:latest -x 1 -y 2 -u "throughput-test-1" -a --id "test 1"

To run the RabbitMQ broker within Docker, and run PerfTest against it, run the
following commands:

 docker network create perf-test
 docker run -it --rm --network perf-test --name rabbitmq -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3.12-management
 docker run -it --rm --network perf-test pivotalrabbitmq/perf-test:latest --uri amqp://rabbitmq
