/**
 * Relaxed version of the {@link DefaultExceptionHandler} that logs network exceptions as info
 * instead of warn.
 *
 * <p>Connections opened by PerfTest can be blocked, especially producer connections. On shutdown,
 * they may take some time to close, so PerfTest closes the connection with a timeout. This can
 * result in noisy logs, which are not useful here, so this exception handler is a bit more relaxed
 * for those logs.
 *
 * <p>This exception handler is also less noisy with {@link AlreadyClosedException}, which can
 * typically happen on shutdown or during connection recovery.
 *
 * @since 2.5.0
