PTR
===

PTR is Parity's native trade reporting protocol.


Architecture
------------

PTR consists of logical, sequenced messages sent by the trading system to
a client application.

PTR uses NASDAQ MoldUDP64 1.00 as the underlying transport protocol. It
implements ordered, reliable IP multicast.


Data Types
----------

Number fields are encoded as unsigned integers in network byte order.

Text fields are encoded as ASCII, left-justified and padded on the right with
the space character.

Prices have decimal fixed-point representation with a six-digit integral part
and a four-digit fractional part.

Timestamps are represented as nanoseconds since the midnight of the day on
which the trading session started.


Messages
--------

All messages are sent by the trading system to the client application.


### Trade

A Trade message indicates that a trade has taken place. The match number and
the order numbers are the trading system's identifiers for the trade and the
executed orders, respectively.
