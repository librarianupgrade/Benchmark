## Contributing to Baigan-Config

Baigan was born out of need for a  configuration mechanism in Java based applications which is
1. Non intrusive.
2. Powerful enough to extend for custom rule based configurations.

With this spirit, contributions are welcome in forms of code, suggestions, bugfix , recommendations and documentation.
