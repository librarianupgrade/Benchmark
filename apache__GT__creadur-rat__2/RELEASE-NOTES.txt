              Apache Creadur Rat 0.13
                  RELEASE NOTES

The Apache Creadur Rat team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Creadur Rat 0.13

Apache Rat is a release audit tool. It improves accuracy and efficiency when checking
releases. It is heuristic in nature: making guesses about possible problems. It
will produce false positives and cannot find every possible issue with a release.
Its reports require interpretation.

In response to demands from project quality tool developers, Rat is available as a
library suitable for inclusion in tools. This POM describes that library.
Note that binary compatibility is not guaranteed between 0.x releases.

Apache Rat is developed by the Apache Creadur project, a language and build
agnostic home for software distribution comprehension and audit tools.

o RAT-228:  Fixing broken Ant unit test setup and making tests run more deterministic. Thanks to Romain Manni-Bucau.
