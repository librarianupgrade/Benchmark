CMB VERSION 2.2.28
--------------------------------------------------------------------

New features and bug fixes:

- added embedded Jetty option allowing to run cqs, cns and cns 
  publish workers all inside the same JVM
- added new bootstrap script cmb.sh to start embedded jetty version
- long poll ReceiveMessage() calls now reuse established TCP connections
  among api servers to distribute send notifications to improve performance
- all admin UI URLs now start with /webui to make load balancer
  configuration easier
- support WaitTime and DelaySeconds as queue attributes (so far only
  supported as parameters on SendMessage() and ReceiveMessage())
- new feature to determine number of queues and topics per user 
  (also displayed in admin UI)
- number of shards is now a queue attribute so queues can be sharded
  across any number of nodes in cassandra (so far default was 100
  for all queues and could only be changed globally)
- major performance improvement for cns topics with few subscribers 
  (typically less than 100 subscribers)
- bug fix for name prefix search for queues in admin UI for large number
  of queues

  for cns worker to discard old messages
- bug fix for memory leak in jmx monitoring bean for cns worker 
- accept access key in http header (aws4 style)
- support for WaitTime parameter in cqs ReceiveMessage() ("long

- no need to switch hosts any more with absolute urls when switching
  between cns and cqs in web ui
- cleaned up and improved performance of xml responses for all
  api calls
- performance tweaks for fast queue and topic creation specifically
  for large numbers of queues and topics
- increased default in-memory cache sizes to 1 mio
- harmonized and cleaned up log4j logging
- cns workers will bootstrap and continue to function even if cqs is
  (temporarily) unavailable
- bug fix for listing queues by prefix api
- support for DelaySeconds parameter in cqs SendMessage()
- ability to trace messages through logs by receipt handle

Upgrading from version 2.2.12:

Add the following column family to the CQS keyspace:

create column family CQSAPIServers
  with column_type = 'Standard'
  and comparator = 'UTF8Type'
  and default_validation_class = 'UTF8Type'
  and key_validation_class = 'UTF8Type'
  and read_repair_chance = 0.1
  and gc_grace = 5
  and min_compaction_threshold = 4
  and max_compaction_threshold = 32
  and replicate_on_write = true
  and compaction_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.SizeTieredCompactionStrategy';
  
create column family CQSQueuesByUserId
  with column_type = 'Standard'
  and comparator = 'UTF8Type'
  and default_validation_class = 'UTF8Type'
  and key_validation_class = 'UTF8Type'
  and read_repair_chance = 0.1
  and gc_grace = 5
  and min_compaction_threshold = 4
  and max_compaction_threshold = 32
  and replicate_on_write = true
  and compaction_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.SizeTieredCompactionStrategy';
  
Add the following column family to the CNS keyspace:
  
create column family CNSAPIServers  
  with column_type = 'Standard'
  and comparator = 'UTF8Type'
  and default_validation_class = 'UTF8Type'
  and key_validation_class = 'UTF8Type'
  and read_repair_chance = 0.1
  and gc_grace = 5
  and min_compaction_threshold = 4
  and max_compaction_threshold = 32
  and replicate_on_write = true
  and compaction_strategy = 'org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction.SizeTieredCompactionStrategy';

CMB VERSION 2.2.12
--------------------------------------------------------------------

New features and bug fixes:

- added support for Cassandra 1.1.X (note there are now different schema
  files for Cassandra 1.0.X and 1.1.X)
- cns worker to recreate cqs queues on the fly when needed
- centralized monitoring and management of cns workers through cns
  endpoint and admin UI  
- cns worker to cache cqs queue urls to ease load on cns api
- adjusted default size of key parameters for cns worker in 
  cmb.properties
- http default timeout of 5 sec for slow endpoints (can be adjusted
  in cmb.properties)
- bug fix: allow publishing of blank messages
- cns worker to temporarily suspend slow or failing endpoints if more 
  than n bad responses are encountered in a rolling window of 60 seconds   
  (threshold can be adjusted in cmb.properties)
- offer configurable white list of acceptable http return codes
  (such as 404 if desired)
- simple login and session management for admin ui to distinguish 
  admin and normal users. Note: Currently the only admin user is 
  the one configured as cmb.cns.user in cmb.properties, typically
  "cns_internal". Access the admin UI from now on using this link:
  http://adminhost:adminport/UserLogin
- various improvements for endpoint servlet (testing tool for cns)
  such as introducing a duplicate counter
