This repository contains simple libraries of common code for OpenGamma.
The main [OpenGamma Platform](http://developers.opengamma.com) builds upon these libraries.

Building OpenGamma Commons
--------------------------
The source code can be cloned using [git](http://git-scm.com/) from GitHub:
```
  git clone https://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Commons.git
```

Each subdirectory of the commons repository is an independent project.
Releases occur at the project level.

The projects use [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) as the build system.
Version 3.0.4 or later is required.
Simply run this command to compile and install the source code locally:

```
  mvn install
```

For more information about developing code on the OpenGamma Platform
see the [developer website](http://developers.opengamma.com).
