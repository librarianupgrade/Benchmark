/**
 * A distributed lightweight event bus which can encompass multiple machines. The event bus
 * implements publish/subscribe, point to point messaging and request-response messaging.<p>
 * Messages sent over the event bus are represented by instances of the {@link Message} class.<p>
 * For publish/subscribe, messages can be published to an address using one of the {@link #publish}
 * methods. An address is a simple {@code String} instance.<p>
 * Handlers are registered against an address. There can be multiple handlers registered against
 * each address, and a particular handler can be registered against multiple addresses. The event
 * bus will route a sent message to all handlers which are registered against that address.<p>
 * For point to point messaging, messages can be sent to a address using one of the {@link #send}
 * methods. The messages will be delivered to a single handler, if one is registered on that
 * address. If more than one handler is registered on the same address, the bus will choose one and
 * deliver the message to that. The bus will aim to fairly distribute messages in a round-robin way,
 * but does not guarantee strict round-robin under all circumstances.<p>
 * The order of messages received by any specific handler from a specific sender should match the
 * order of messages sent from that sender.<p>
 * When sending a message, a reply handler can be provided. If so, it will be called when the reply
 * from the receiver has been received. Reply messages can also be replied to, etc, ad infinitum<p>
 * Different event bus instances can be clustered together over a network, to give a single logical
 * event bus.<p>
