	 *  A transition is the process of notifying listeners when the location changes.
	 *  It is not an API; rather, it is a concept. Transitions may be interrupted by transition hooks
	 *  Note: A transition does not refer to the exact moment the URL actually changes. For example, in web browsers
	 *  the user may click the back button or otherwise directly manipulate the URL by typing into the address bar.
	 *  This is not a transition, but a history object will start a transition as a result of the URL changing.

	 * prompt them to confirm they actually want to leave the page before they lose the information they've already entered.
	 *
	 * @param transitionHook a hook function that takes the location and returns a boolean that tells if the transition
	 *                       is accepted (true) or prevented (false)

	 * not be notified of the new location)! If your app is slow for some reason, this could lead to a non-responsive UI.
	 *
	 * @param transitionHook a hook asynchronous function that takes the location and returns a future boolean that will
