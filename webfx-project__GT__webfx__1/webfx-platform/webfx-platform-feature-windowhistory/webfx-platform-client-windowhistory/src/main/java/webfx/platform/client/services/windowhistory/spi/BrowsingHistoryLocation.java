/**
 * A location answers two important (philosophical) questions:
 * Where am I?
 * How did I get here?
 * New locations are typically created each time the URL changes.
 *
 * A location object is conceptually similar to document.location in web browsers, with a few extra goodies.
 * Location objects have the following properties:
 *  - pathname      The pathname portion of the URL, without query string
 *  - search        The query string portion of the URL, including the ?
 *  - state         An object of data tied to this location
 *  - action        One of PUSH, REPLACE, or POP
 *  - key           A unique identifier for this location
