/**
 * Container for a message (data and object references) that can
 * be sent through an IBinder. A Parcel can contain both flattened data
 * that will be unflattened on the other side of the IPC (using the various
 * methods here for writing specific types, or the general {@link Parcelable} interface), and
 * references to live {@link IBinder} objects that will result in the other side receiving a proxy
 * IBinder
 * connected with the original IBinder in the Parcel.
 * <p class="note">
 * Parcel is <strong>not</strong> a general-purpose serialization mechanism. This class (and the
 * corresponding {@link Parcelable} API for placing arbitrary objects into a Parcel) is designed as
 * a high-performance IPC transport. As such, it is not appropriate to place any Parcel data in to
 * persistent storage: changes in the underlying implementation of any of the data in the Parcel can
 * render older data unreadable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The bulk of the Parcel API revolves around reading and writing data of various types. There are
 * six major classes of such functions available.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Primitives</h3>
 * <p>
 * The most basic data functions are for writing and reading primitive data types:
 * {@link #writeByte}, {@link #readByte}, {@link #writeDouble}, {@link #readDouble},
 * {@link #writeFloat}, {@link #readFloat}, {@link #writeInt}, {@link #readInt}, {@link #writeLong},
 * {@link #readLong}, {@link #writeString}, {@link #readString}. Most other data operations are
 * built on top of these. The given data is written and read using the endianess of the host CPU.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Primitive Arrays</h3>
 * <p>
 * There are a variety of methods for reading and writing raw arrays of primitive objects, which
 * generally result in writing a 4-byte length followed by the primitive data items. The methods for
 * reading can either read the data into an existing array, or create and return a new array. These
 * available types are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #writeBooleanArray(boolean[])}, {@link #readBooleanArray(boolean[])},
 * {@link #createBooleanArray()}
 * <li> {@link #writeByteArray(byte[])}, {@link #writeByteArray(byte[], int, int)},
 * {@link #readByteArray(byte[])}, {@link #createByteArray()}
 * <li> {@link #writeCharArray(char[])}, {@link #readCharArray(char[])}, {@link #createCharArray()}
 * <li> {@link #writeDoubleArray(double[])}, {@link #readDoubleArray(double[])},
 * {@link #createDoubleArray()}
 * <li> {@link #writeFloatArray(float[])}, {@link #readFloatArray(float[])},
 * {@link #createFloatArray()}
 * <li> {@link #writeIntArray(int[])}, {@link #readIntArray(int[])}, {@link #createIntArray()}
 * <li> {@link #writeLongArray(long[])}, {@link #readLongArray(long[])}, {@link #createLongArray()}
 * <li> {@link #writeStringArray(String[])}, {@link #readStringArray(String[])},
 * {@link #createStringArray()}.
 * <li> {@link #writeSparseBooleanArray(SparseBooleanArray)}, {@link #readSparseBooleanArray()}.
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Parcelables</h3>
 * <p>
 * The {@link Parcelable} protocol provides an extremely efficient (but low-level) protocol for
 * objects to write and read themselves from Parcels. You can use the direct methods
 * {@link #writeParcelable(Parcelable, int)} and {@link #readParcelable(ClassLoader)} or
 * {@link #writeParcelableArray} and {@link #readParcelableArray(ClassLoader)} to write or read.
 * These methods write both the class type and its data to the Parcel, allowing that class to be
 * reconstructed from the appropriate class loader when later reading.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are also some methods that provide a more efficient way to work with Parcelables:
 * {@link #writeTypedArray}, {@link #writeTypedList(List)}, {@link #readTypedArray} and
 * {@link #readTypedList}. These methods do not write the class information of the original object:
 * instead, the caller of the read function must know what type to expect and pass in the
 * appropriate {@link Parcelable.Creator Parcelable.Creator} instead to properly construct the new
 * object and read its data. (To more efficient write and read a single Parceable object, you can
 * directly call {@link Parcelable#writeToParcel Parcelable.writeToParcel} and
 * {@link Parcelable.Creator#createFromParcel Parcelable.Creator.createFromParcel} yourself.)
 * </p>
 * <h3>Bundles</h3>
 * <p>
 * A special type-safe container, called {@link Bundle}, is available for key/value maps of
 * heterogeneous values. This has many optimizations for improved performance when reading and
 * writing data, and its type-safe API avoids difficult to debug type errors when finally
 * marshalling the data contents into a Parcel. The methods to use are {@link #writeBundle(Bundle)},
 * {@link #readBundle()}, and {@link #readBundle(ClassLoader)}.
 * <h3>Active Objects</h3>
 * <p>
 * An unusual feature of Parcel is the ability to read and write active objects. For these objects
 * the actual contents of the object is not written, rather a special token referencing the object
 * is written. When reading the object back from the Parcel, you do not get a new instance of the
 * object, but rather a handle that operates on the exact same object that was originally written.
 * There are two forms of active objects available.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link Binder} objects are a core facility of Android's general cross-process communication
 * system. The {@link IBinder} interface describes an abstract protocol with a Binder object. Any
 * such interface can be written in to a Parcel, and upon reading you will receive either the
 * original object implementing that interface or a special proxy implementation that communicates
 * calls back to the original object. The methods to use are {@link #writeStrongBinder(IBinder)},
 * {@link #writeStrongInterface(IInterface)}, {@link #readStrongBinder()},
 * {@link #writeBinderArray(IBinder[])}, {@link #readBinderArray(IBinder[])},
 * {@link #createBinderArray()}, {@link #writeBinderList(List)}, {@link #readBinderList(List)},
 * {@link #createBinderArrayList()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * FileDescriptor objects, representing raw Linux file descriptor identifiers, can be written and
 * {@link ParcelFileDescriptor} objects returned to operate on the original file descriptor. The
 * returned file descriptor is a dup of the original file descriptor: the object and fd is
 * different, but operating on the same underlying file stream, with the same position, etc. The
 * methods to use are {@link #writeFileDescriptor(FileDescriptor)}, {@link #readFileDescriptor()}.
 * <h3>Untyped Containers</h3>
 * <p>
 * A final class of methods are for writing and reading standard Java containers of arbitrary types.
 * These all revolve around the {@link #writeValue(Object)} and {@link #readValue(ClassLoader)}
 * methods which define the types of objects allowed. The container methods are
 * {@link #writeArray(Object[])}, {@link #readArray(ClassLoader)}, {@link #writeList(List)},
 * {@link #readList(List, ClassLoader)}, {@link #readArrayList(ClassLoader)}, {@link #writeMap(Map)}, {@link #readMap(Map, ClassLoader)}, {@link #writeSparseArray(SparseArray)},
 * {@link #readSparseArray(ClassLoader)}.
