## MacroBase core operator library

Basic operators for explaining differences in 
high-dimensional data using categorical attributes.

This package only contains the mathematical operators which will
need external support code to configure and run them. See tests such as
`UnsupervisedCSVTest` and `StreamingSummarizationTest`
for examples of usage.

At a high level we provide

- Classifiers
- Summarizers
- Transformers
