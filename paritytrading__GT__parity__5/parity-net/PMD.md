PMD
===

PMD is Parity's native market data protocol. With it market participants can
maintain a view of the state of the market.


Architecture
------------

PMD consists of logical, sequenced messages sent by the trading system to the
client application.

PMD uses NASDAQ MoldUDP64 as the underlying transport protocol. It implements
ordered, reliable IP multicast.


Data Types
----------

Number fields are encoded as unsigned integers in network byte order.

Text fields are encoded as ASCII, left-justified and padded on the right with
the space character.

Prices have decimal fixed-point representation with a six-digit integral part
and a four-digit fractional part.

Timestamps are represented as nanoseconds since the beginning of the current
second.


Messages
