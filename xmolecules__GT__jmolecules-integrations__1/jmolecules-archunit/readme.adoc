= jMolecules ArchUnit rules

This module contains https://www.archunit.org/[ArchUnit] rules to verify the integrity of domain concepts expressed via https://github.com/xmolecules/jmolecules#expressing-ddd-concepts[jMolecules DDD annotations or types].

To use these rules, declare the following artifact as dependency of your project:

.Maven dependency
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jmolecules.integrations</groupId>
  <artifactId>jmolecules-archunit</artifactId>
  <version>${jmolecules-integrations.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The provided rules can then be used in a JUnit test as follows:

[source, java, tabsize="2"]
----
@AnalyzeClasses(packages = "example") // <1>
class JMoleculesRulesUnitTest {

  @ArchTest ArchRule dddRules = JMoleculesDddRules.all(); // <2>
  @ArchTest ArchRule onion = JMoleculesArchitectureRules.ensureOnionSimple(); // <2>

  // alternatively

  @ArchTest // <3>
  void detectsViolations(JavaClasses classes) {

    EvaluationResult result = JMoleculesDddRules.all().evaluate(classes);

    assertThat(result.hasViolation()).isFalse();
  }
}
----
<1> The `@AnalyzeClasses(â€¦)` annotation defines the scope of the classes to be verified.
This is likely to be the base package of your application.
<2> The property style architecture definition can be used simply declaring the rule as a field annotated with `@ArchTest`.
ArchUnit will verify the classes pointed to by <1> and the test will fail if violations occur.
<3> If you prefer to manually evaluate the violations, you can also declare a method annotated with `@ArchTest` and get the classes scanned for handed in as method argument.

For detailed information about the rules, be sure to check out the types and method definitions in  https://github.com/xmolecules/jmolecules-integrations/blob/main/jmolecules-archunit/src/main/java/org/jmolecules/archunit[`org.jmolecules.archunit`].
