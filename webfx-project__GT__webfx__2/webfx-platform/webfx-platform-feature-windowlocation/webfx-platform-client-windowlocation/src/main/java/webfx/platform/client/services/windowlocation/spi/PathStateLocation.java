 * A location descriptor is the pushable analogue of a location.
 * The history object uses locations to tell its listeners where they are, while history users use location descriptors
 * to tell the history object where to go.
 * The object signature is compatible with that of location, differing only in ignoring the internally-generated
 * action and key fields. This allows you to build a location descriptor from an existing location, which can be used to
 * change only specific fields on the location.
