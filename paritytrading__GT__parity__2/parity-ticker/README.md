Parity Stock Ticker
===================

Parity Stock Ticker is a simple console application that displays the best
bids and offers (BBOs) and latest trades in Parity Trading System.


Usage
-----

Run Parity Stock Ticker with Java:

    java -jar <executable> [-t] <configuration-file>

After starting, the stock ticker first replays market events that have taken
place before it started. Then it proceeds to display market events in real
time.

By default, the stock ticker formats its output for display. If the `-t`
option is given, it formats the output as [TAQ][] instead.
