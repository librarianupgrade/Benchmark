**EqualsVerifier** can be used in Java unit tests to verify whether the contract for the equals and hashCode methods in a class is met.

For documentation, please see the [project's website](http://www.jqno.nl/equalsverifier).

Pull requests are welcome! If you open one, please also [register an issue](https://code.google.com/p/equalsverifier/issues/list) or [send a message to the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/equalsverifier), so we can discuss it.
